# Analysing the DCG Contagion Effect

## About the Project

A network graph is a visual representation of the relationships between investors and projects connected through capital raising events, such as seed stage or Series A. In this graph, each investor or project is represented by a node, and the connections between them (i.e., the capital commitments made by investors to projects in a capital raise event) are represented by edges. The weight of each edge represents the total size of the capital raise event.

In the case of DCG, the network graph shows all of the nodes that are connected to them as well as all of the nodes that are related to those nodes, up to a depth of 2. This can be used to understand the degree of impact that DCG has on a particular project or investor by identifying the number and value of capital raises they have in common within the network surrounding DCG. The more they are connected within the network, the more significant the impact, which is also reflected by the size of the font in the graph.

## Question looking to answer

In the event that DCG goes down, how bad can I expect the contagion effect to impact me?
